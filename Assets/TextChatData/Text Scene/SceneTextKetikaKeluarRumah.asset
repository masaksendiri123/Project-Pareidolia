  - "As I stepped out of their house, the night air felt heavier than before. The
    door closed behind me, trapping their hope and my lies inside. Their questions,
    their trembling voices, still echoed in my head. <br><br>  They trusted me.<br>

    to steady.<br><br>  If only she knew the truth.<br><br>  This interview bought
    me a little more time.<br> But guilt has a way of following you home\u2026<br>
