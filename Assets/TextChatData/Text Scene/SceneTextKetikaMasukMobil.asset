  - "That night, I had just taken another person\u2019s life. I cant Sleep event
    though I closed my eyes, the pressure of what I\u2019d done pressed down on my
    chest, and the lingering fear clawed at the back of my mind like a restless shadow.
    <br> <br>  The next morning, as part of my job as a journalist, I was assigned
    to investigate a missing person case. I knew exactly who they were looking for.
    I knew the truth, and I knew the guilt was mine. But I couldn\u2019t bring myself
    to confess. Instead, I was forced to construct an alibi carefully crafted lies
    and fabricated evidence to wrap the cracks of the crime I had committed. The
    only way to survive\u2026 was to bury the truth deeper than the body itself."
