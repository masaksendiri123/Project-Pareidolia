  - "I stepped into the house, the air thick with a silence that clung to my skin
    like cold fog. Every corner of the room reminded me of the night I took their
    child from them. Yet here I was posing as a journalist pretending to help them
    seek answers I already knew too well. <br><br>  The mother\u2019s eyes were swollen
    from nights without sleep. But I forced a calm smile.<br><br>  I just needed
    the interview\u2026<br> I needed to control the story."
