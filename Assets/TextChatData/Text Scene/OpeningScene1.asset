  - 15 November 2013<br><br>  20:46<br><br>  My name is Evan Cross, a journalist
    at The Halcyon Report. on this very day I have been tasked to investigate a missing
    person case by my agency. Usually the police handle such tasks but it seemed
    our team wanted a more hands on approach. Hence, I ended up here. At a desolate
    place searching for any lead about the last known locations of "Daniel Hughes"
    or so the people thought.<br><br>  [Truth is, I was the one who killed him.]<br><br> 
    It was an accident I had a few days prior to this that just so happened to be
    the case I am reporting. Somehow, I managed to bury the truth to the ground just
    barely. The only reason I came here was to make sure it stays that way.
